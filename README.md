# search_3d_sites_cli
Search 3D sites using command line shell script

Place the `3d` file where you can run it. How to do this is beyond the scope of this README.

Let's say you want to search for `pokemon`, enter `3d pokemon` and it will pop open a tab for each site listed in the URLs section of the script.

If you want to search for `black panther`, enter `3d "black panther"`. You have to use quotation marks since the search term uses spaces.

You can add/remove sites to search by modifying the `urls=` in the file.

The `REPLACE_ME` text is where the search terms go. For any site you add you will need to do a test search to see what the URL will need to be for that site.

Happy Hunting!
